#### Workshop: Automating Build, Test, and Deployment of a Web or Containerized Application on AWS

In this workshop, we will learn how to leverage AWS services to build and deploy a complete CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a web or containerized application without the need for local development.

### AWS Services Required for This Workshop:

1. **CodeCommit**: A source control service for managing and sharing application code.
2. **CodePipeline**: Automates the CI/CD workflow, moving code from CodeCommit through the build, test, and deployment stages.
3. **CodeBuild**: Builds and tests the application code from CodeCommit, allowing you to create Docker images and push them to ECR.
4. **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: A Docker image repository to store built versions of the application.
5. **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Manages and runs containers on AWS infrastructure, making it easy to deploy applications using Fargate.
6. **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Distributes traffic to containerized applications, ensuring scalability and stability for the service.
7. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages access permissions for services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECS to ensure security and efficiency.
8. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Stores artifacts or logs from CodeBuild for monitoring and analysis.

### Workshop Plan:

Throughout the workshop, you will:
- Set up **CodeCommit** to store your application's source code.
- Configure **CodePipeline** to automate the CI/CD process.
- Use **CodeBuild** to build Docker images and push them to **ECR**.
- Deploy the containerized application on **ECS** with **Application Load Balancer**.
- Use **IAM** to manage secure access permissions across AWS services.
- Store logs and artifacts in **S3** for monitoring and review.

Letâ€™s dive into each step to set up the CI/CD pipeline on AWS!
