In this section, we will guide you through deploying a containerized application on AWS using **Amazon ECS** and **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. These services enable automatic scaling and high availability for your application, ensuring it can handle variable loads effectively.

### Overview of Application Deployment

Our deployment steps include:
- Setting up an ECS Cluster to manage the containerized application.
- Defining ECS Task Definitions to specify the application container details.
- Configuring an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across containers in the ECS Cluster.

Follow each subsection carefully to complete the deployment setup. This guide is designed for beginners to grasp the fundamentals of deploying a scalable application on AWS.
