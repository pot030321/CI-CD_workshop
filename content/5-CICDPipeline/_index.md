## CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Deployment

In this section, we will set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline using AWS services such as CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECR. This pipeline will automate the deployment process, ensuring code updates are efficiently integrated, built, and deployed to a containerized environment on AWS.

### Content Overview

- **[5.1 - CodeCommit](5.1-CodeCommit/)**: Setting up a repository in CodeCommit for version control.
- **[5.2 - CodePipeline](5.2-CodePipeline/)**: Creating a pipeline to automate the CI/CD workflow.
- **[5.3 - CodeBuild](5.3-CodeBuild/)**: Configuring a build environment for compiling and packaging the code.
- **[5.4 - ECR](5.4-ECR/)**: Setting up Amazon ECR to store Docker images.

By the end of this section, you will have a fully operational CI/CD pipeline that can handle code updates automatically.
